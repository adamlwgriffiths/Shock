Shock C++ Platform Abstraction Library

Shock is self-contained platform abstraction library.
It provides common utilities and cross-platform wrappers.

I created Shock with the goal of creating a cross-platform library that didn't depend on any 3rd party libraries. I found Boost to be over-engineered; the existing stdlib to be horrible; C++0x to be lacking and not supported on older MSVC instances.

Some areas of Shock we're in the middle of planning / development (assert, etc) and need to be removed. I plan to do this in the near future.

The Socket and Ping modules are directly imported from my previous AWE implementation. As such, they do not compile yet, but only require trivial fixes.

If you make use of this project, I'd love to hear about it, no matter how trivial =).
