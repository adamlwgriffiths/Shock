Shock is self-contained platform abstraction library.
It provides common utilities and cross-platform wrappers.

I created Shock with the goal of creating a cross-platform library that didn't depend on any 3rd party libraries. I found Boost to be over-engineered; the existing stdlib to be horrible; C++0x to be lacking and not supported on older MSVC instances.

Some areas of Shock we're in the middle of planning / development (assert, etc) and need to be removed. I plan to do
this in the near future.

I also have a Socket library that uses Shock that I will integrate and release soon.

If you make use of this project, I'd love to hear about it, no matter how trivial =).
