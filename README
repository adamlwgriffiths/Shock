Shock C++ Platform Abstraction Library
Created by: Adam Griffiths <adam.lw.griffiths@gmail.com>

Shock is self-contained platform abstraction library.
It provides common utilities and cross-platform wrappers.

I created Shock with the goal of creating a cross-platform library that didn't depend on any 3rd party libraries. I found Boost to be over-engineered; the existing stdlib to be horrible; C++0x to be lacking and not supported on older MSVC instances.
